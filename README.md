Reflection:
The first half of this reflection will be brief, over the submission period my IBS Health condition and a migraine has stopped me from doing as much work on the project as I wanted to. 

I have howeever managed to get the thumbnail positionied, working properly, and have made sure all the images are linked with an alt text for accessability. Including a media query on sizing as of right now, everything is responsive. The final thing to do is to make the images fill the full screen, which was the final task before my IBs and Migraine took hold. I will continue to work on this when I am able, my understanding of Loops and functions has greatly increased however, as well as further understanding of responsive design. I also fully understand how to use media queries effectively.
